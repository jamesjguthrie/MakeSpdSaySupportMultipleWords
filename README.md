# MakeSpdSaySupportMultipleWords

It was annoying me that calling `spd-say` with multiple words (arguments) after it wouldn't make the synthesizer SAY all the words. You can put the words in `' '` but that's obnoxious if you're used to macOS's say command.

Add an alias to the location of the script in your .bashrc `alias say=/home/jabo/sayScript.sh`
